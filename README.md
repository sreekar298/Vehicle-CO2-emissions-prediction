# Vehicle-CO2-emissions-prediction
This project aims to predict the Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of automobiles and understand which factors affect emissions. In the dataset, we have specifications like number of cylinders, engine size, fuel type, transmission type, etc. for ~26k models of automobiles sold in Canada from 1995 - 2022.
